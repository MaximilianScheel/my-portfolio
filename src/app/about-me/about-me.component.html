    <p data-aos="fade-up" style="max-width: 800px;">
      I'm a passionate web developer experienced in building interactive web
      applications using Angular, TypeScript, JavaScript, and OOP. Transitioning
      from a business administration background, I discovered my true passion
      for automating processes through programming.

      I've completed training at
      the Developer Academy and actively contributed to over 12 projects, both
      individually and as part of a team. From dynamic websites to task
      management tools and CRM systems, I've gained valuable experience in
      diverse settings. As an enthusiastic and driven developer, I'm constantly
      seeking new experiences and challenges. Let's connect and explore how I
      can contribute to your team or project, leveraging my expertise in
      collaborative and individual project environments.
